• Open Source Recovery is a groundbreaking initiative that aims to revolutionize the way we approach addiction recovery. It has been designed to be an innovative and forward-thinking program that empowers its clients by providing a proof of attendance protocol and minting governance coins for voting. 

• With the use of AI and ML technologies, Open Source Recovery is able to track each client's progress and success rate with accuracy. Additionally, it is always available for support when needed. 

• OpenSource Recovery incentivizes clients for their progress by awarding them governance tokens for demonstrating their commitment to the recovery process. This allows individuals in recovery from substance abuse or addiction disorders to actively pursue healthier lifestyles through the means of positive reinforcement.

• The potential market size for chemical dependency treatment services is huge with only 4 million people currently receiving care in America alone. To capitalize on this opportunity, Open Source Recovery has created several sources of revenue including fees from clients, consulting services, educational seminars, etc. 

• To further promote sustainable lifestyles among those involved in addiction recovery programs, Open Source Recovery has developed SARA - an AI assistant specifically tailored towards providing helpful tips and visuals that correspond with each individual’s journey to sobriety. 

• By introducing ground-breaking innovations such as SARA into the world of addiction recovery care, Open Source Recovery hopes to contribute positively towards achieving lasting change not just within America but worldwide as well.
